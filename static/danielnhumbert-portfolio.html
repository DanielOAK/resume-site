        <p class="about-box-1"> Hello, my name is Daniel Humbert,  I am an aspiring web developer / designer.  I have spent the last ten years working in the vending industry and I am ready for a change.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about-box-1">In December of 2015 I started my journey into coding with a basic course on html. During 2016 I took two courses of study through <a href="http://codeconvoy.com/">Code Convoy</a>. The first was an introduction to html,css and javascript. In the second course I worked in a paired-programming environment and built a web application using the MEAN stack. Also during that time I also earned several introductory certificates in css, Js, sql, and php. Currently I am studying Ruby and my next project will take me into Rails. I have an understanding  of MVC, CRUD, and RESTfull programming.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about-box-1">Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to put my skills to work and expand my knowledge and ability in an environment of creativity, flexibility and open thinking that will continue to challenge me.</p>
